#### Webpack with laravel-mix (npm package)

For your convenience, we use laravel-mix npm package *(frontend-only)*.

Package provides a fluent API for defining Webpack build steps using several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors. Through simple method chaining, you can fluently define your asset pipeline.

* Asset pipeline is configured in `webpack.mix.js`
* js and scss source files are located in `src` folder
